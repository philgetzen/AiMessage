# AiMessage Simplified Import System Migration

## Summary of Changes

This migration simplifies the import system by removing unreliable database import attempts and focusing on a clear two-step process that actually works.

## Files Changed

### 1. New Files Created
- `AiMessage/Views/ImportView.swift` - New simplified import flow UI

### 2. Files Modified
- `AiMessage/Services/FileImporter.swift` - Removed 500+ lines of database import code
- `AiMessage/ContentView.swift` - Updated to use new ImportView and auto-navigation

### 3. Files Removed/Renamed
- `AiMessage/Views/DropZoneView.swift` → `DropZoneView.swift.old` (kept as backup)

### 4. Documentation Updated
- `CLAUDE.md` - Updated to reflect new architecture

## Key Improvements

1. **Removed Complexity**
   - Eliminated all database import code that fails due to macOS security
   - Removed confusing multiple import paths
   - Simplified from ~1000 lines to ~400 lines

2. **Better UX**
   - Clear two-step process: Export → Import
   - Terminal command is the primary (and only) export method
   - One-click command copy + Terminal launch
   - Auto-navigation to Analysis tab after import

3. **Improved Reliability**
   - Only includes code that actually works
   - Better CSV parsing with multiple date formats
   - Clear error messages

## Migration Steps

1. The app will now start with the Import tab showing clear export instructions
2. Users follow the two-step process instead of trying database import
3. After successful import, the app automatically switches to the Analysis tab

## Rollback

If needed, the old DropZoneView.swift is preserved as DropZoneView.swift.old and can be restored.

## Next Steps

Now that import is simplified and working, focus should shift to:
1. Implementing Apple Foundation Models integration
2. Building out the analysis pipeline
3. Creating meaningful visualizations

## Technical Notes

- The Terminal export command remains unchanged
- CSV format is the same as before
- All existing CSV files will continue to work
- The Message model remains unchanged for compatibility
