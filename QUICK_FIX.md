# Quick Fix: Get Running Now!

Since you're having trouble adding ImportView.swift to the Xcode project, here's a quick solution to get you running immediately:

## Option 1: Add ImportView code to ContentView.swift (Temporary)

1. Open `ContentView.swift` in Xcode
2. Add this line at the very top after the existing imports:
```swift
import UniformTypeIdentifiers
```

3. Scroll to the very bottom of the file (just before `#Preview`)
4. Paste all the ImportView code there (see ContentView_with_ImportView.swift in this directory)

5. Build and run - it should work!

## Option 2: Use the provided combined file

I've created a file with everything combined:
1. In Xcode, select ContentView.swift
2. Select all (Cmd+A) and delete
3. Copy the entire contents of `ContentView_with_ImportView.swift`
4. Paste into ContentView.swift
5. Build and run

## After it's working:

Once you see the app running with the new import flow, you can properly organize the files:
1. Create a new file in Xcode: File > New > File > Swift File
2. Name it "ImportView.swift"
3. Cut the ImportView code from ContentView.swift
4. Paste it into the new ImportView.swift file
5. Add the imports at the top of ImportView.swift:
```swift
import SwiftUI
import UniformTypeIdentifiers
```

This gets you running immediately while you sort out the project structure!
