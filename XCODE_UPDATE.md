# Xcode Project Update Instructions

After making the code changes, you'll need to update your Xcode project:

1. **Remove old file from Xcode**:
   - In Xcode, find `DropZoneView.swift` in the project navigator
   - Right-click and select "Delete"
   - Choose "Remove Reference" (the file is already backed up as .old)

2. **Add new file to Xcode**:
   - Right-click on the "Views" folder in Xcode
   - Select "Add Files to AiMessage..."
   - Navigate to `AiMessage/Views/ImportView.swift`
   - Make sure "Copy items if needed" is unchecked (file is already there)
   - Click "Add"

3. **Build and Run**:
   - Press Cmd+B to build
   - Press Cmd+R to run

The app should now launch with the simplified import flow!
