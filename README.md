## Privacy & Security

AiMessage is designed with privacy as the core principle:
- ‚úÖ **100% Local Processing** - Your data never leaves your Mac
- ‚úÖ **No External Services** - No APIs, no cloud processing, no data transmission
- ‚úÖ **Native Tools Only** - Uses Apple's built-in frameworks and Foundation Models
- ‚úÖ **Sandboxed Application** - Minimal permissions, maximum security
- ‚úÖ **Secure Export Process** - Instructions use only native macOS command-line tools

## Getting Started

### Requirements

- macOS 14.0 or later
- Xcode 15.0 or later (for development)
- Apple Silicon or Intel Mac

### Installation

1. Clone this repository
2. Open `AiMessage.xcodeproj` in Xcode
3. Build and run the project

## Exporting Your iMessage Data

**Important**: AiMessage requires you to export your iMessage data first. We provide secure, native-only methods to do this.

### üîí Secure Export Methods

We provide two comprehensive guides for exporting your iMessage data using **only native macOS tools**:

#### Option 1: Detailed Manual Guide
See **[SECURE_IMESSAGE_EXPORT.md](SECURE_IMESSAGE_EXPORT.md)** for complete step-by-step instructions using SQLite3 command line.

#### Option 2: Automated Scripts
Use our pre-built shell scripts in the `export_scripts/` directory:

```bash
# Export all messages
./export_scripts/export_all_messages.sh

# Export messages with specific contact
./export_scripts/export_contact_messages.sh
```

### Why Native Tools Only?

- **üõ°Ô∏è Maximum Security** - No third-party software with unknown data practices
- **üîç Full Transparency** - You can see exactly what commands are executed
- **‚ö° Apple Optimized** - Uses Apple's own SQLite implementation
- **üö´ Zero Dependencies** - No external downloads or installations required

### Supported Export Formats

#### CSV Format (Recommended)
```csv
timestamp,text,sender,isFromMe,chatIdentifier
"2024-06-19 14:30:15","Hello!","Me",true,"direct"
"2024-06-19 14:32:42","Hi there!","+1234567890",false,"direct"
```

See `sample_data/` directory for example files.
